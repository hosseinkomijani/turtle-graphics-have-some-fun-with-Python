# turtle-graphics, have-some-fun-with-Python

I had a presentation about programming in a primary school, and I was wondering how I could talk about it for students aged under 10 with no background in programming.
I thought it would be a good idea to have some fun with programming and make some visual/animation presentations. To do so, I chose turtle lib to get students' attention.

After the presentation, they get wondered and thought programming as something magical. they started asking how they can make some graphs like them by themselves. I hope to have some great programmers from them in near future!
